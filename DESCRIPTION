Package: ffaframework
Title: Flood Frequency Analysis Framework
Description: Tools to support systematic and reproducible workflows for both 
	stationary and nonstationary flood frequency analysis, with applications 
	extending to other hydroclimate extremes, such as precipitation frequency 
	analysis. This package implements the FFA framework proposed by Vidrio-
	Sahagún et al. (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105940>, originally 
	developed in MATLAB, now adapted for the R environment. This work was 
	funded by the Flood Hazard Identification and Mapping Program of Environment 
	and Climate Change Canada, as well as the Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) 
	awarded to Dr. Pietroniro.
