# FFA Framework Wiki

The **FFA Framework** is an open-source tool for flood frequency analysis (FFA) designed to support systematic and repeatable workflows for stationary and nonstationary analysis.
Development is ongoing at the University of Calgary and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.

The most recent version of the framework is freely available as an **R package**.
The [original version](https://zenodo.org/records/8012096) was released as a stand-alone GUI with MATLAB source code and published in [Vidrio-Sahag√∫n et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105940).
For a list of changes from the MATLAB version, see [here](articles/matlab-version.html).
