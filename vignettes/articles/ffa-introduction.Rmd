# Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA)

## Overview

**Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA)** uses a _probability distribution_ fitted to extreme streamflow observations (e.g., annual maxima) to estimate the _recurrence likelihood_ of floods. To perform FFA, we require a [probability model](model-selection.md) and corresponding [parameter estimates](parameter-estimation.md) based on the data.

FFA relates flood peak magnitudes $Q$ to their expected frequency of occurrence, expressed as a *return period*.
For example, a flood with a 10-year return period—commonly referred to as a *10-year flood*—has a 1-in-10 chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.
This corresponds to an *annual exceedance probability* of $p_e = 0.1$.
Since the FFA Framework uses annual maxima data, this equates to the 90th percentile (i.e., the $0.90$ quantile) of the fitted probability distribution.

Here is a summary of the return periods, exceedance probabilities, and associated quantiles used by default in the FFA framework:

| Return Period ($T$) | Exceedance Probability ($p_e$)   | Quantile ( $F(q)$ )|
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2 Years             | 0.50                             | 0.50              |
| 5 Years             | 0.20                             | 0.80              |
| 10 Years            | 0.10                             | 0.90              |
| 20 Years            | 0.05                             | 0.95              |
| 50 Years            | 0.02                             | 0.98              |
| 100 Years           | 0.01                             | 0.99              |

Let $F(q)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the fitted model. This function maps flood magnitudes to exceedance probabilities: $p_e = 1 - F(q)$.
To estimate flood magnitudes for a given exceedance probability, we use the inverse of the CDF, better known as the *quantile function*: $\hat{q} = F^{-1}(p_e)$.

### Example Plot

FFA results are typically visualized with return period on the $x$-axis and flood magnitude on the $y$-axis. These plots can be interpreted in two directions:

1. Estimate *flood magnitude* for a given return period. 
   For example, A 50-year flood is estimated to be about $85\ \text{m}^3/\text{s}$.

2. Estimate *return period* for a given flood magnitude.
   For example, A streamflow of $50\ \text{m}^3/\text{s}$ is expected to occur roughly every 4 years.

## Handling Nonstationarity

A probability model is considered *nonstationary* if its statistical properties (e.g., location or scale) change over time. In such cases, the quantile function becomes time-dependent: $F^{-1}(p_e, t)$.  
As a result, return levels and exceedance probabilities vary with time, and a static return period curve is no longer valid.
To address this, the FFA framework computes *effective return periods*, which yield flood estimates for a specific year based on the time-varying distribution.

### Example Plot

The plot below illustrates *effective return levels* for the years 1920, 1960, and 2000.
Remember, a 100-year effective return level does *not* imply that such a flood is expected to occur once in the next 100 years.
Instead, it means that *in a given year*, the probability of exceeding the effective return level is 1 in 100.
