# Model Selection

This module selects a statistical model for S-FFA or NS-FFA based on the annual maximum series.

- **S-FFA**: A time-invariant probability distribution is selected from the candidate distributions.
- **NS-FFA**: A distribution is chosen along with a nonstationary structure to capture its evolution over time. In piecewise NS-FFA, the series is segmented into subperiods, each modeled with either time-invariant or time-varying distributions.

The framework uses the **L-moment ratio method** to identify the best-fit distribution family by comparing sample L-moments with the L-moments of various distribution families.

For NS-FFA, the series is decomposed to isolate its stationary component following [Vidrio-Sahagún and He (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128186).
This decomposed sample is then used for distribution selection, as in S-FFA.


## An Introduction to L-Moments

**Definition 1**: The **$k$-th Order Statistic** of a statistical sample is its $k$-th smallest value.

**Definition 2**: The **$r$-th Population L-moment** $\lambda_{r}$ is a linear combination of the expectation of the order statistics. Let $X_{k:n}$ be the $k$-th order statistic from a sample of size $n$. Then,

$$
\lambda_{r} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{k=0}^{r-1} (-1)^{k} \binom{r-1}{k} \mathbb{E}[X_{r-k:r}]
$$

**Definition 3**: A **Probability Weighted Moment** (PWM) encodes information about a value's position on the cumulative distribution function. The $r$-th PWM, denoted $\beta_{r}$, is:

$$
\beta_{r} = \mathbb{E}[X \cdot  F(X)^{r}]
$$

For an ordered sample $x_{1:n} \leq  \dots  \leq  x_{n:n}$, the sample PWM is often estimated as:

$$
b_{r} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{r} x_{i:n} \left(\frac{i-1}{n-1}\right) ^{r}
$$

### Sample L-Moments (from PWMs) and L-Moment Ratios

The first four sample L-moments can be computed as linear combinations of the PWMs:

$$
\begin{aligned}
l_{1} &= b_{0} \\
l_{2} &= 2b_{1} - b_{0} \\
l_{3} &= 6b_{2} - 6b_{1} + b_{0} \\
l_{4} &= 20b_{3} - 30b_{2} + 12b_{1} - b_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The L-moments are used to compute the **Sample L-variance** $t_{2}$, **Sample L-skewness** $t_{3}$ and the **Sample L-kurtosis** $t_{4}$ using the following formulas:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_{2} &= l_{2} / l_{1} \\
t_{3} &= l_{3} / l_{2} \\ 
t_{4} &= l_{4} / l_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Then, we compare these statistics, specifically the L-skewness and L-kurtosis to their theoretical values (given [here](probability-distributions.md)) using one of three different metrics to select a distribution.

**Note**: Probability distributions with two parameters have constant L-skewness $\tau_{3}$ and L-kurtosis $\tau_{4}$ regardless of their parameters.
The L-skewness and L-kurtosis of probability distributions with three parameters is a function of the shape parameter $\kappa$.
The notation $\tau_{3}(\kappa)$ and $\tau_{4}(\kappa)$ refers to the L-skewness and L-kurtosis *curves* for three parameter distributions.

### Example Plot

Shown below are the L-moment curves of the GEV, GLO, GNO, PE3/LP3, and WEI distributions as well as the L-moment ratios of the two parameter distributions GUM and NOR/LNO.
This L-moment diagram depicts the "L-distance" selection metric, which compares the euclidian distance between the sample and theoretical L-moment ratios.
The inset shows that the GEV distribution (yellow line) has the closest L-moments to the data.

## Selection Metrics

### 1. L-Distance

The Euclidean distance between the sample $(t_3, t_4)$ and theoretical $(\tau_3, \tau_4)$ for each candidate distribution.
For 3-parameter distributions, this is the **minimum** distance along their L-moment ratio curve.

### 2. L-Kurtosis

The L-kurtosis method is only used for three-parameter probability distributions.
First, the shape parameter $\kappa^{*}$ such that $t_{3} = \tau _{3}(\kappa ^{*})$ is identified.
Then, the difference between the sample L-kurtosis and the theoretical L-kurtosis is computed using the metric $|\tau_{4}(\kappa ^{*}) - t_{4} |$.

### 3. Z-statistic

The Z-statistic selection metric is calculated as follows (for three-parameter distributions):

1. Fit the four-parameter Kappa (K4D) distribution to the sample.
2. Generate $N_{\text{sim}}$ bootstrap samples from the fitted K4D distribution.
3. Calculate the sample L-kurtosis $t_{4}^{[i]}$ of each synthetic dataset.
4. Calculate the bias and standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution:

    $$
    B_{4} = N_{\text{sim} }^{-1} \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{sim} }} \left(t_{4}^{[i]} - t_{4}^{s}\right)
    $$

    $$
    \sigma _{4} = \left[(N_{\text{sim} } - 1)^{-1} \left\{\sum_{i - 1}^{N_{\text{sim} }} \left(t_{4}^{[i]} - t_{4}^{s}\right)^2 - N_{\text{sim} } B_{4}^2\right\} \right] ^{\frac{1}{2}}
    $$

5. Identify the shape parameter $\kappa^{*}$ such that $t_{3} = \tau _{3}(\kappa ^{*})$.
6. Use the bootstrap distribution to compute the Z-statistic for each distribution:

    $$
    z = \frac{\tau_{4} (\kappa ^{*}) - t_{4} + B_{4} }{ \sigma _{4}}
    $$

7. Choose the distribution with the *smallest* Z-statistic.

## Handling Nonstationarity

When nonstationarity is detected, the annual maximum series is decomposed before model selection. We consider three nonstationary scenarios that can be identified in EDA:

1. Trend in mean only.
2. Trend in standard deviation only.
3. Trend in both mean and standard deviation.

### Decomposition Steps

#### Scenario 1: Trend in mean

1. Use [Sen's Trend Estimator](eda-trend-ams-mean.md#sens-trend-estimator) to approximate the slope $b_1$ and intercept $b_0$.
2. Detrend: subtract the linear function $(b_{1} \cdot \text{Covariate})$ from the time series, where the *covariate* is a time index calculated using the formula $(\text{Years} - 1900) / 100$.
3. Ensure positivity: if necessary, shift series by adding a constant such that $\min(\text{data}) = 1$.

#### Scenario 2: Trend in standard deviation

1. Generate a time series of standard deviations using the moving windows method.
2. Use [Sen's Trend Estimator](eda-trend-ams-variability.md#sens-trend-estimator) to identify the slope $c_{1}$ and intercept $c_{0}$ of the trend in the standard deviations.
3. Normalize the data to have mean $0$, then divide out the scale factor $g_{t}$.

    $$
    g_{t} = \frac{(c_{1} \cdot  \text{Covariate} ) + c_{0}}{c_{0}}
    $$

4. Add back the long-term mean $\mu$, and then ensure positivity as in Scenario 1.

#### Scenario 3: Trend in both mean and standard deviation

1. Remove the linear trend in mean exactly as in Scenario 1.
2. On that detrended series, generate a rolling‐window STD series and fit its trend.
3. Divide the detrended data by the time-varying scale factor $g_{t}$ (as in Scenario 2).
4. Shift to preserve the series mean and ensure positivity.
