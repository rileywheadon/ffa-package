This package provides tools for stationary and non-stationary flood frequency analysis (FFA) based on annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data.
The package supports flexible workflows with the following core components:

1. **Explore** AMS data using the `eda_*` methods:
	- Detect change points.
	- Identify trends in the *mean* and *variance*.
2. **Select** a suitable probability model using the `select_* ` methods.
3. **Fit** model parameters using the `fit_*` methods.
4. **Quantify** uncertainty using the `uncertainty_*` methods.
5. **Evaluate** model performance using `model_diagnostics()`.

Additional utility functions support visualization and computation:

- `plot_*` methods produce diagnostic and summary plots.
- `ams_*` methods transform or segment AMS time series.
- `quantile_*`, `loglik_*`, and `lmom_*` implement distribution-specific computation.

This package assumes familiarity with modern statistical techniques used in FFA, including L-moments, maximum likelihood estimation, and bootstrapping.
For an explanation of these concepts, see the [FFA Framework wiki](https://rileywheadon.github.io/ffa-docs/).
For examples, see the accompanying vignettes on exploratory data analysis, change point detection, and flood frequency analysis.
