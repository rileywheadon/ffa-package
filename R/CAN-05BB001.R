#'
#' A dataframe of annual maximum series observations for 
#' station 05BB001, BOW RIVER AT BANFF in Alberta, Canada. 
#'
#' @section Additional Information:
#' This is an unregulated station in the RHBN. Whitfield & Pomeroy (2016) found that 
#' floods may be caused by rain, snow, or a combination of both. Therefore, practitioners should 
#' be careful when interpreting the results of FFA. Minimal human intervention in the basin 
#' means there is little justification for change points. EDA finds evidence of a decreasing 
#' trend in the mean.
#'
#' @format A dateframe with 110 rows and 2 columns spanning the period 1909-2018.
