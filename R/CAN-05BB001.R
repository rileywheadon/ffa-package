#' CAN-05BB001
#'
#' A dataframe of annual maximum series observations for 
#' station 05BB001, BOW RIVER AT BANFF in Alberta, Canada. 
#'
#' @section Features:
#' - Whitfield & Pomeroy (2016) found that floods are caused separately by both rain *and* snow.
#'   Therefore, practitioners should use *extreme caution* when performing FFA on this station.
#' - Minimal human intervention in the basin means there is little evidence of change points. 
#' - Trend detection finds evidence of a decreasing trend in the mean.
#'
#' This dataset is used as a test case for comparison with the MATLAB implementation of the 
#' FFA framework. It is also an excellent introduction to nonstationary FFA for students.
#'
#' @format A dateframe with 110 rows and 2 columns spanning the period 1909-2018.

#' - `year`: Integer; the corresponding year.
