#' White Test for Heteroskedasticity
#'
#' Performs the White test for heteroskedasticity by regressing the squared residuals 
#' of a linear model on the original regressors and their squared terms. The null 
#' hypothesis is homoskedasticity.

#'
#' @return A list containing the results of the White test:
#' - `data`: The `data` argument.
#' - `years`: The `years` argument.
#' - `r_squared`: Coefficient of determination from the auxiliary regression.
#' - `statistic`: White test statistic based on sample size and `r_squared`.
#' - `p_value`: The p-value derived from a Chi-squared distribution with `df = 2`.
#' - `reject`: Logical. If `TRUE`, the null hypothesis is rejected at `alpha`.
#' - `msg`: Character string summarizing the test result, printed if `quiet = FALSE`.
#'
#' @details
#' The White test regresses the squared residuals from a primary linear model 
#' `lm(data ~ years)` against both the original regressor and its square. 
#' The test statistic is calculated as \eqn{nR^2}, where \eqn{R^2} is the 
#' coefficient of determination from the auxiliary regression. Under the null 
#' hypothesis, the test statistic has the \eqn{\chi^2} distribution.
