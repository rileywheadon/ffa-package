#' White Test for Heteroskedasticity in Annual Maximum Streamflow
#'
#' Performs the White test for heteroskedasticity by regressing the squared residuals of a linear
#' model on the original regressors and their squared terms. The null hypothesis is homoskedasticity.
#'
#' @param data Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow values with no missing values.
#' @param years Numeric vector of years corresponding to \code{data}, with no missing values.
#' @param alpha Numeric significance level for the test (default is 0.05).
#' @param quiet Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message to the console (default is TRUE).
#'
#' @return A named list containing:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{r.squared}{Coefficient of determination from the auxiliary regression.}
#'   \item{statistic}{White test statistic based on sample size and auxiliary \code{R^2}.}
#'   \item{p.value}{P-value computed from the Chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.}
#'   \item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis is rejected at \code{alpha}.}
#'   \item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' The White test regresses the squared residuals from a primary linear model \code{lm(data ~ years)}
#' against both the original regressor and its square. The test statistic is calculated as
#' \code{n * R^2}, where \code{R^2} is from the auxiliary regression. Under the null hypothesis,
#' this statistic follows a \eqn{\chi^2} distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.
#'
#' Rejection of the null hypothesis suggests the presence of heteroskedasticity in the residuals.
