#' CAN-08NM050
#'
#' A dataframe of annual maximum series observations for 
#' station 08NM050, OKANAGAN RIVER AT PENTICTON in British Columbia, Canada. 
#'
#' @section Additional Information:
#' This is a regulated station that is not part of the RHBN. The Okanagan River upstream of 
#' the station has been regulated since 1914 due to the construction of the first dam, followed 
#' by a second dam in 1920, and a regulation system in the early 1950s, consisting of four dams 
#' and 38 km of engineered channel. Rapid human settlement, development, and agricultural 
#' activity have also occurred in the watershed.
#'
#' This dataset exhibits serial correlation and trends in both the mean and variability.
#' Since the station is heavily influenced by reservoir operations, this dataset is intended 
#' for teaching purposesâ€”not for practical flood estimation.
#'
#' @format A dataframe with 97 rows and 2 columns spanning the period 1921-2017.
