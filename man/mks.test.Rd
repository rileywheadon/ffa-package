\title{Mann–Kendall–Sneyers Test for Detecting Change Points in Trends}
\usage{
mks.test(data, years, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow values with no missing values.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector of years corresponding to \code{data}, with no missing values.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level for the test (default 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical flag to suppress or print a summary message (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{s.progressive}{Normalized progressive Mann–Kendall statistics over time.}
\item{s.regressive}{Normalized regressive Mann–Kendall statistics over time.}
\item{bound}{Critical confidence bound for significance based on \code{alpha}.}
\item{crossing.df}{Data frame of crossing points with indices, years, statistics, and AMS values.}
\item{change.df}{Subset of \code{crossing_df} where crossing statistics exceed confidence bounds.}
\item{p.value}{Two-sided p-value assessing the significance of maximum crossing statistic.}
\item{reject}{Logical indicating whether null hypothesis of no change point is rejected.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).}
}
}
\description{
Performs the Mann–Kendall–Sneyers (MKS) test to detect the approximate time of onset
of a monotonic trend in annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data. The test computes
progressive and regressive Mann–Kendall statistics and identifies statistically
significant crossing points, indicating potential change points in the trend.
}
\details{
The function computes progressive and regressive Mann–Kendall statistics \(S_t\),
normalized by their expected values and variances under the null hypothesis. The crossing
points where the difference between these normalized statistics changes sign are
identified using linear interpolation. The significance of detected crossings is
assessed using normal quantiles and the maximum absolute crossing statistic.
