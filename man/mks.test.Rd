\title{Mann–Kendall–Sneyers Test for Change Point Detection}
\usage{
mks.test(data, years, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{years}{Numeric; a vector of years with the same length as \code{data}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric (1); the significance level (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical (1); if FALSE, prints a summary of results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
List; results of the MKS test:
\itemize{
\item \code{s.progressive}: Normalized progressive Mann–Kendall statistics.
\item \code{s.regressive}: Normalized regressive Mann–Kendall statistics.
\item \code{bound}: Critical confidence bound for significance based on \code{alpha}.
\item \code{crossing.df}: Data frame of crossing points with indices, years, statistics, and AMS.
\item \code{change.df}: Subset of \code{crossing.df} with statistically significant crossings.
\item \code{p.value}: Two-sided p-value assessing the significance of maximum crossing statistic.
\item \code{reject}: Logical indicating whether null hypothesis of no change point is rejected.
\item \code{msg}: Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).
}

\description{
Performs the Mann–Kendall–Sneyers (MKS) test to detect the beginning of a monotonic
trend in annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data. The test computes normalized
progressive and regressive Mann–Kendall statistics and identifies statistically
significant crossing points, indicating potential change points in the trend.
}
\details{
The function computes progressive and regressive Mann–Kendall statistics \eqn{S_t},
normalized by their expected values and variances under the null hypothesis. The crossing
points where the difference between these normalized statistics changes sign are
identified using linear interpolation. The significance of detected crossings is
assessed using normal quantiles and the maximum absolute crossing statistic.
