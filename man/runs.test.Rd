\title{Perform a Wald–Wolfowitz runs test on model residuals}
\usage{
runs.test(residuals, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{Numeric vector of residual values from a fitted linear model.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level for the runs test (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message describing results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
\item{p.value}{P-value from the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test applied to residuals.}
\item{residuals}{Numeric vector of residual values from a fitted linear model.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if null hypothesis of random residuals is rejected.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result.}
}
}
\description{
\code{runs.test} applies the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test to a numeric vector of
residuals in order to assess whether they behave as a random sequence.  The
test statistic’s p-value is compared to the specified significance level
\code{alpha}, and a pass/fail decision is returned along with a human-readable
summary message.
}
\details{
The Wald–Wolfowitz runs test examines the sequence of positive and negative
residuals to test for randomness around the median. A small p-value suggests
non-random clustering, which may indicate that a linear model is inappropriate
for the data.

Internally, this function calls \code{\link[randtests]{runs.test}}.
