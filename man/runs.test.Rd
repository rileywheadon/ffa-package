\title{Wald–Wolfowitz Runs Test for Randomness}
\usage{
runs.test(residuals, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{Numeric; A vector of residuals produced by \link{sens.trend}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric (1); the significance level (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical (1); if FALSE, prints a summary of results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
List; test results, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{p.value}: P-value from the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test applied to residuals.
\item \code{residuals}: Numeric vector of residual values from a fitted linear model.
\item \code{reject}: Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis of random residuals is rejected.
\item \code{msg}: Character string summarizing the test result.
}

\description{
Wald–Wolfowitz Runs Test for Randomness
}
\details{
The Wald–Wolfowitz runs test examines the sequence of residuals to test for
randomness around the median. A small p-value suggests non-random clustering,
which may indicate that a linear model is inappropriate for the data.
}
\examples{
# Initialize data and years
data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
years <- seq(from = 1901, to = 2000)

# Perform the runs test
residuals <- sens.trend(data, years)$residuals
runs.test(residuals)
