\title{Plot Uncertainty Bounds and Estimates Over Time}
\usage{
uncertainty.plot(results)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A \code{list} containing the uncertainty analysis output.
Generated by \code{\link{sb.uncertainty}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing:
\itemize{
\item A dashed black line for both the lower and upper confidence bounds.
\item A gray ribbon between \code{ci_lower} and \code{ci_upper}, semi‐transparent.
\item A solid blue line for the point estimates.
\item A log10‐scaled x‐axis with ticks at each \code{t}.
}
}
\description{
Constructs a time–series plot of parameter estimates with their associated
confidence intervals. The confidence bounds are shown as a shaded ribbon,
and the point estimates are overlaid as a solid line. The x-axis is displayed
on a log10 scale.
