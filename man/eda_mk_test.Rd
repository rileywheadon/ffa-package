\title{Mann–Kendall Trend Test}
\usage{
eda_mk_test(data, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow (AMS) values.
Must be strictly positive, finite, and non-missing.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar in \eqn{[0.01, 0.1]}. The significance
level for confidence intervals or hypothesis tests. Default is 0.05.}

\item{quiet}{Logical scalar. If \code{FALSE}, prints a summary of of the statistical
test to the console. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the test results, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: The \code{data} argument.
\item \code{s_statistic}: The Mann–Kendall test statistic \eqn{S}.
\item \code{s_variance}: The variance of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
\item \code{p_value}: The p-value associated with the two-sided hypothesis test.
\item \code{reject}: Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the null hypothesis is rejected at \code{alpha}.
\item \code{msg}: A character string summarizing the result, printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}.
}
}
\description{
Performs the Mann–Kendall trend test on a numeric vector to detect the presence
of a monotonic trend (increasing or decreasing) over time. The test is
non-parametric and accounts for tied observations in the data. The null
hypothesis assumes there is no monotonic trend.
}
\details{
The statistic \eqn{S} is computed as the sum over all pairs \eqn{i < j} of the
sign of the difference \eqn{x_j - x_i}. Ties are explicitly accounted for when
calculating the variance of \eqn{S}, using grouped frequencies of tied observations.
The test statistic \eqn{Z} is then computed based on the sign and magnitude of
\eqn{S}, and the p-value is derived from the standard normal distribution.
