\title{Phillips–Perron Unit Root Test}
\usage{
pp.test(ams, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ams}{Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow data with no missing values.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level. Must be one of 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message to the console (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{p.value}{Reported p-value from the test. See notes on interpolation thresholds.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected at \code{alpha}.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).}
}
}
\description{
Applies the Phillips–Perron (PP) test to assess the presence of a unit root in annual
maximum streamflow (AMS) data. The null hypothesis is that the series contains a unit root
(i.e., is non-stationary).
}
\details{
The test is implemented using the \pkg{aTSA} package, which interpolates p-values from the
critical values in Banerjee et al. (1993). The critical values are only available for
\code{alpha = 0.01}, \code{0.05}, and \code{0.10}. A reported p-value of 0.01 indicates
\eqn{p \leq 0.01}, and 0.10 indicates \eqn{p \geq 0.10}.

The null hypothesis is that the time series contains a unit root (non-stationary). Rejection
of the null suggests that the series is stationary.
