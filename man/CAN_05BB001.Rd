\description{
A dataframe of annual maximum series observations for
station 05BB001, BOW RIVER AT BANFF in Alberta, Canada.
}
\details{
Variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{max}: Numeric; the annual maximum series (AMS) observation, in m\eqn{^3}{^3}/s.
\item \code{year}: Integer; the corresponding year.
}

\section{Features}{

\itemize{
\item Whitfield & Pomeroy (2016) found that floods are caused separately by both rain \emph{and} snow.
Therefore, practitioners should use \emph{extreme caution} when performing FFA on this station.
\item Minimal human intervention in the basin means there is little evidence of change points.
\item Trend detection finds evidence of a decreasing trend in the mean.
}

This dataset is used as a test case for comparison with the MATLAB implementation of the
FFA framework. It is also an excellent introduction to nonstationary FFA for students.
