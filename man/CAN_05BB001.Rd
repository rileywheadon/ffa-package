\section{Additional Information}{

This is an unregulated station in the RHBN. Whitfield & Pomeroy (2016) found that
floods may be caused by rain, snow, or a combination of both. Therefore, practitioners should
be careful when interpreting the results of FFA. Minimal human intervention in the basin
means there is little justification for change points. EDA finds evidence of a decreasing
trend in the mean.
