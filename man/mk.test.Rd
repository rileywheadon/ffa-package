\title{Mann–Kendall Test for Monotonic Trends}
\usage{
mk.test(data, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector of AMS values or their variances. Must not contain NA values.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance level (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary of the test result to the console.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{s.statistic}{The raw Mann–Kendall test statistic \(S\).}
\item{s.variance}{The variance of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.}
\item{p.value}{The p-value associated with the two-sided hypothesis test.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected at \code{alpha}.}
}
}
\description{
Performs the Mann–Kendall trend test on a numeric vector to detect the presence of a monotonic
trend (increasing or decreasing) over time. The test is non-parametric and accounts for tied
observations in the data.
}
\details{
The statistic \(S\) is computed as the sum over all pairs \(i < j\) of the sign of the
difference \(x_j - x_i\). Ties are explicitly accounted for when calculating the variance of
\(S\), using grouped frequencies of tied observations.

The test statistic \(Z\) is then computed based on the sign and magnitude of \(S\), and the
p-value is derived from the standard normal distribution.
