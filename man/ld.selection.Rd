\title{L-Distance Method for Distribution Selection Using L-Moment Ratios}
\usage{
ld.selection(ams)
}
\arguments{
\item{ams}{A numeric vector containing the AMS data without NaN values}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{distance}{A list of fitted moment points for each candidate distribution with
associated L-distance metrics.}
\item{recommendation}{The name of the distribution with the smallest L-distance.}
}
}
\description{
Selects the best-fit distribution from a candidate set by minimizing the Euclidean distance
between theoretical and sample L-moment ratios (\eqn{\tau_3}, \eqn{\tau_4}). This method
quantifies goodness-of-fit in the L-moment ratio space and returns the closest matching
distribution.
}
\details{
For each candidate distribution, the method computes the Euclidean distance between
sample L-moment ratios (\eqn{\tau_3}, \eqn{\tau_4}) and the closest point on the
theoretical distribution's L-moment surface. The distribution with the minimum distance
is selected.

If a distribution is flagged as requiring log-transformed data, the \code{log_lm}
component is used for matching.
