\title{Plot Model Assessment Results}
\usage{
assessment.plot(data, assessment)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{assessment}{List; model assessment results generated by \link{model.assessment}.}
}
\value{
\code{ggplot}; a plot containing:
\itemize{
\item A black line for the theoretical 1:1 relationship between observed and model quantiles.
\item Red points marking the estimated quantiles against the observed quantiles.
}
}
\description{
Creates a quantile–quantile plot comparing observed annual maximum streamflow (AMS)
data to quantile estimates from a fitted parametric model. The 1:1 line is drawn in
black and the model estimates are plotted as semi‐transparent red points.
}
\examples{
# Initialize example data, years, and params
data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
years <- seq(from = 1901, to = 2000)
params <- c(100, 10)

# Perform uncertainty analysis
uncertainty <- sb.uncertainty(data, years, "NOR", "L-moments")

# Perform model assessment
assessment <- model.assessment(data, years, "NOR", params, uncertainty)

# Generate a model assessment plot
assessment.plot(data, assessment)
