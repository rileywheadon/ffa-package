\title{Plot Model vs. Observed Quantiles for Assessment Results}
\usage{
assessment.plot(data, assessment)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of observed annual maximum series.}

\item{assessment}{List containing assessment results. See \code{\link{model.assessment}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing:
\itemize{
\item A black line for the theoretical 1:1 relationship between observed and model quantiles.
\item Red points marking the model’s estimated quantiles against the observed quantiles.
}
}
\description{
Creates a quantile–quantile plot comparing observed annual maximum series (AMS)
to model‐derived quantile estimates. The 1:1 line is drawn in black, and the
model estimates are overplotted as semi‐transparent red points.
}
\details{
The function orders \code{data} in decreasing order to define the observed quantiles,
then binds the corresponding \code{assessment$estimates} into a data frame. Axis labels
are rendered with expression notation (cubic meters per second).
