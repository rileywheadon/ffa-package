\title{Spearman Test for Serial Correlation in Time Series}
\usage{
spearman.test(data, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow data with no missing values.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message describing the result (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{rho}{Vector of Spearman autocorrelation estimates for lags \code{1} to \code{n - 3}.}
\item{sig}{Logical vector indicating which lags exhibit significant autocorrelation.}
\item{least.lag}{The smallest lag at which autocorrelation is not statistically significant.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if we reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).}
}
}
\description{
Performs the Spearman rank autocorrelation test on annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data to
assess the presence of serial correlation at various lags. Reports the first lag where
autocorrelation is no longer statistically significant at the specified level.
}
\details{
For each lag from 1 to \code{n - 3}, the function computes the Spearman rank correlation
between the AMS series and its lagged version. The first lag with a non-significant
autocorrelation (p-value > \code{alpha}) is returned as \code{least.lag}.

This test is useful for identifying the minimum temporal separation required to ensure
approximate independence, especially when constructing block-bootstrap resampling schemes.
