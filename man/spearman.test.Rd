\title{Spearman Test for Autocorrelation}
\usage{
spearman.test(data, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric (1); the significance level (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical (1); if FALSE, prints a summary of results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
List; test results, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{rho}: Vector of Spearman autocorrelation estimates for lags \eqn{1} to \eqn{n - 3}.
\item \code{sig}: Logical vector indicating which lags exhibit significant autocorrelation.
\item \code{least.lag}: The smallest lag at which the autocorrelation is not statistically significant.
\item \code{reject}: Logical. TRUE if \code{least.lag > 0}.
\item \code{msg}: Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).
}
}
\description{
Performs the Spearman rank autocorrelation test on annual maximum streamflow
(AMS) data to check for autocorrelation at various lags. Reports the smallest
lag where the autocorrelation is not statistically significant at the given
significance level.
}
\details{
For each lag from \eqn{1} to \eqn{n - 3}, the function computes the Spearman correlation
coefficient between the AMS series and its lagged version. The first lag with an
insignificant autocorrelation coefficient returned as \code{least.lag}.
