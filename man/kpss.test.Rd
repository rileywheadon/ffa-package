\title{Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) Unit Root Test}
\usage{
kpss.test(data, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow data. Must not contain NA values.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value indicating the significance level. Must be at least 0.01 (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message to the console (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{statistic}{The KPSS test statistic.}
\item{p.value}{The reported p-value from the test. See notes regarding discrete thresholds.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis of stationarity is rejected at \code{alpha}.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test outcome, printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}.}
}
}
\description{
Performs the KPSS test for stationarity in annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data
using an implementation based on the \pkg{aTSA} package. The null hypothesis is that
the time series is trend-stationary with a linear trend. The alternative hypothesis
is that the time series has a unit root (non-stationarity).
}
\details{
The implementation of the KPSS test is based on the \pkg{aTSA} package, which interpolates
a significance table from Hobjin et al. (2004). Therefore, a result of \eqn{p = 0.01}
implies that \eqn{p \leq 0.01} and a result of \eqn{p = 0.10} implies that \eqn{p \geq 0.10}.
This implementation uses the Type III KPSS test, which accounts for a linear trend in the data.
