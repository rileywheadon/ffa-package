\title{White Test for Heteroskedasticity in Annual Maximum Streamflow}
\usage{
white.test(data, years, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of annual maximum streamflow values with no missing values.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector of years corresponding to \code{data}, with no missing values.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message to the console (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{r.squared}{Coefficient of determination from the auxiliary regression.}
\item{statistic}{White test statistic based on sample size and auxiliary \code{R^2}.}
\item{p.value}{P-value computed from the Chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if the null hypothesis is rejected at \code{alpha}.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the test result (printed if \code{quiet = FALSE}).}
}
}
\description{
Performs the White test for heteroskedasticity by regressing the squared residuals of a linear
model on the original regressors and their squared terms. The null hypothesis is homoskedasticity.
}
\details{
The White test regresses the squared residuals from a primary linear model \code{lm(data ~ years)}
against both the original regressor and its square. The test statistic is calculated as
\code{n * R^2}, where \code{R^2} is from the auxiliary regression. Under the null hypothesis,
this statistic follows a \eqn{\chi^2} distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.

Rejection of the null hypothesis suggests the presence of heteroskedasticity in the residuals.
