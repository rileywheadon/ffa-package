\title{L-Distance Method for Distribution Selection}
\usage{
select_ldistance(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of annual maximum series (AMS) values.
Must be strictly positive, finite, and not missing.}
}
\value{
A list with the results of distribution selection:
\itemize{
\item \code{method}: \code{"L-distance"}.
\item \code{data}: The \code{data} argument.
\item \code{metrics}: A list of L-distance metrics for each candidate distribution.
\item \code{recommendation}: The name of the distribution with the smallest L-distance.
}
}
\description{
Selects a distribution from a set of candidate distributions by minimizing the
Euclidean distance between the theoretical L-moment ratios \eqn{(\tau_3, \tau_4)}
and the sample L-moment ratios \eqn{(t_3, t_4)}.
}
\details{
For each candidate distribution, the method computes the Euclidean distance between
sample L-moment ratios (\eqn{\tau_3}, \eqn{\tau_4}) and the closest point on the
theoretical distribution's L-moment curve. For two-parameter distributions (Gumbel,
Normal, Log-Normal), the theoretical L-moment ratios are compared directly with
the sample L-moment ratios. The distribution with the minimum distance is selected.
If a distribution is fit to log-transformed data (Log-Normal or Log-Pearson Type
III), the L-moment ratios for the log-transformed sample are used instead.
