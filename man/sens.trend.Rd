\title{Sen's Slope Estimator with Residual Randomness Test}
\usage{
sens.trend(data, year, alpha = 0.05, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of AMS values or variances with no missing values.}

\item{year}{Numeric vector of years corresponding to \code{data}, with no missing values.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric significance level for the runs test (default is 0.05).}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE, prints a summary message describing results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{sens.slope}{Median slope of all pairwise data-year combinations (Sen's slope).}
\item{sens.intercept}{Median intercept estimate of the fitted line.}
\item{residuals}{Vector of residuals between observed and fitted values.}
\item{p.value}{P-value from the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test applied to residuals.}
\item{reject}{Logical. TRUE if null hypothesis of random residuals is rejected.}
\item{msg}{Character string summarizing the estimator and test result.}
}
}
\description{
Computes Sen's slope estimator and intercept for a univariate time series and evaluates the
randomness of the residuals using the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test. This method provides a
non-parametric linear trend estimate and a post hoc check on model adequacy.
}
\details{
Sen's slope estimator is a robust, non-parametric trend estimator computed from the median
of all pairwise slopes between data points. The corresponding intercept is taken as the
median of residual-corrected values. To assess the assumption of independence in residuals,
the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test is applied to the residual sequence.

Rejection of the null hypothesis in the runs test indicates non-randomness in residuals,
which may suggest model misfit or autocorrelation.
