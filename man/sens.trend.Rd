\title{Sen's Trend Estimator}
\usage{
sens.trend(data, years, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{years}{Numeric; a vector of years with the same length as \code{data}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical (1); if FALSE, prints a summary of results (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
List; the estimated trend:
\itemize{
\item \code{sens.slope}: Median slope of all pairwise data-year combinations.
\item \code{sens.intercept}: Median intercept estimate of the fitted line.
\item \code{residuals}: Vector of residuals between observed and fitted values.
\item \code{msg}: Character string summarizing the results.
}
}
\description{
Computes Sen's trend estimator for a univariate time series.
}
\details{
Sen's slope estimator is a robust, non-parametric trend estimator computed from the median
of all pairwise slopes between data points. The corresponding intercept is taken as the
median of residual-corrected values.
}
\examples{
data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
years <- seq(from = 1901, to = 2000)
sens.trend(data, years)
