\title{Plot Results from the Pettitt Change‐Point Test}
\usage{
pettitt.plot(data, years, results, show_trend = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{years}{Numeric; a vector of years with the same length as \code{data}.}

\item{results}{List; results of the Pettitt test, generated by \link{pettitt.test}.}

\item{show_trend}{Logical; if TRUE (default), draw a fitted line through the AMS data.}
}
\value{
\code{patchwork}; A plot object with two \code{ggplot2} panels stacked vertically.
}
\description{
Creates a two‐panel visualization of the Mann–Whitney–Pettitt test. The
upper panel plots the Pettitt \eqn{U_t} statistic over time along with the
significance threshold and potential change point. The lower panel displays
the annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data with an optional trend line,
estimates of the mean, and potential change point.
}
\examples{
data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
years <- seq(from = 1901, to = 2000)
results <- pettitt.test(data, years)
pettitt.plot(data, years, results)
