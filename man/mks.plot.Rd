\title{Plot Mann–Kendall–Sneyers (MKS) Test Results}
\usage{
mks.plot(data, years, results, show_trend = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric; a vector of annual maximum streamflow data.}

\item{years}{Numeric; a vector of years with the same length as \code{data}.}

\item{results}{List; results of the MKS test, generated by \link{mks.test}.}

\item{show_trend}{Logical; if TRUE (default), draw a fitted line through the AMS data.}
}
\value{
\code{patchwork}; A plot object with two \code{ggplot2} panels stacked vertically.
}
\description{
Constructs a two‐panel visualization of the MKS test. The upper panel plots the
normalized progressive and regressive Mann–Kendall S‐statistics over time, with
dashed confidence bounds and potential trend‐change points. The lower panel
contains the annual maximum streamflow (AMS) data with the change points highlighted
points along with an optional trend line.
}
\examples{
data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
years <- seq(from = 1901, to = 2000)
results <- mks.test(data, years)
mks.plot(data, years, results)
